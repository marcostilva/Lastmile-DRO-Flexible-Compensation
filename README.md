# Lastmile-DRO-Flexible-Compensation
 Flexible Compensation Scheme for Crowdshipping Last-mile Delivery

In this work we study a flexible compensation scheme for last-mile
delivery with the option of crowdshipping. There, a company outsources
part of the activity of delivering products to its customers to occasional
drivers, complementing its own fleet. Occasional drivers are defined as
independent agents, which are free to accept or reject assignments and
are offered a small compensation in return of their services. We study the
influence of the level of the compensation fee on the occasional driversâ€™
willingness to accept or reject the task assigned to them. We adopt a flexible compensation model where the compensation level to be payed for each
possible outsourced customer is defined a priori, during a planning phase.
Furthermore, we model it as a data-driven decision-dependent worst-case
distribution stochastic approach to the capacitaded vehicle routing problem. Solving the resultant model is challenging and, to reduce the associ-
ated complexity, we propose an extended formulation that can be solved
with the use of a branch-price-and-cut algorithm. Based on this branch-
price-and-cut algorithm we also propose a heuristic approximation in order to cope with larger instances of the problem. Through computational
experiments we analyze the solution and performance of the implemented
algorithms.
